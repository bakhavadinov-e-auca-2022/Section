What is the purpose of the landing page (your site)?
A landing page is any web page that a customer may 
arrive on, but in marketing, it's generally a standalone
page, separate from your homepage or any other website, 
that serves a particular and focused goal. A landing page 
serves as a follow-up to any promises made in your content. 
Essentially, it is the next stage in the process of a visitor becoming a client.
In exchange for supplying contact information, your landing page allows you to make a trade, 
a special offer, a piece of information, or a bargain.

Who is your target audience?
The term "target audience" refers to a specific group of people
or individuals that a product, service, message, or content is intended
to reach and appeal to. Identifying a target audience is a fundamental concept
in marketing and communication because it helps businesses and organizations tailor
their efforts to cater to the needs, interests, demographics, and preferences of a particular
group of potential consumers or users.In my case it is Buyers/Customers of product Iphone in New York City,

What is the call to action (CTA)?
A Call to Action (CTA) is a prompt 
or instruction designed to encourage 
an immediate response or action from the audience,
typically in the context of marketing, advertising, 
or communication. CTAs are commonly used in various forms of media, 
including websites, emails, social media posts, advertisements, and more. 
The primary purpose of a CTA is to guide or persuade the audience to take
a specific action that aligns with the goals of the organization or individual using it.
